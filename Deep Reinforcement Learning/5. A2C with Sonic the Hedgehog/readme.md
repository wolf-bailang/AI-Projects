## How to use A2C? 📖
## If you want to understand the code
Read the [notebook](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/blob/master/A2C%20with%20Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog/How%20works%20Sonic%20A2C.ipynb)

⚠️ First you need to follow Step 1 (Download Sonic the Hedgehog)
### Watch our agent playing 👀
- **Modify the environment**: change `env.make_train_3`with the env you want in `env= DummyVecEnv([env.make_train_3]))` in play.py
- **See the agent playing**: run `python play.py`

### Continue to train 🏃‍♂️
⚠️ There is a big risk **of overfitting**
- Run `python agent.py`
